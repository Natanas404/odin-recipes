# odin-recipes

This is the first project of The Odin Project's foundation course.
The goal is to create a basic website using the knowledge about html that I have acquired up to now.
The website will present an index page, along with other pages presenting recipies.

Knowledge used:
    - boilerplate html: first, written entirely by myself, then using VS Code's shortcut.
    - commands used to edit text in an html document
    - commands used to create lists in an html document
    - commands used to insert hyperlinks and images in an html document
    - how to properly commit a project on GitHub

Steps that I believe might be most challenging at that point:
    - know when to commit to GitHub, that is to say, often and yet not to often
    - write proper commit messages
