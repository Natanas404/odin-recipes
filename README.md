# odin-recipes

<p>This is the first project of The Odin Project's foundation course.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a basic website using the knowledge about html that I have acquired up to now.</p>
<p>The website will present an index page, along with other pages presenting recipies.</p>

<p>Knowledge used:</p>
    <uo>
        <li>- boilerplate html: first, written entirely by myself, then using VS Code's shortcut.</li>
        <li>- commands used to edit text in an html document</li>
        <li>- commands used to create lists in an html document</li>
        <li>- commands used to insert hyperlinks and images in an html document</li>
        <li>- how to properly commit a project on GitHub</li>
    </uo>

<p>Steps that I believe might be most challenging at that point:</p>
    <uo>
        <li>- know when to commit to GitHub, that is to say, often and yet not to often</li>
        <li>- write proper commit messages</li>


<p>Start of project: 02/10/2024</p>
