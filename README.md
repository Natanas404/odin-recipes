# odin-recipes

<p>This is the first project of The Odin Project's foundation course.</p>
<p>The goal is to create a basic website using the knowledge about html that I have acquired up to now.</p>
<p>The website will present an index page, along with other pages presenting recipes.</p>

<p>Knowledge used:</p>
    <uo>
        <li> boilerplate html: first, written entirely by myself, then using VS Code's shortcut.</li>
        <li> commands used to edit text in an html document</li>
        <li> commands used to create lists in an html document</li>
        <li> commands used to insert hyperlinks and images in an html document</li>
        <li> how to properly commit a project on GitHub</li>
    </uo>

<p> </p>

<p>Steps that I believe might be most challenging at that point:</p>
    <uo>
        <li> know when to commit to GitHub, that is to say, often and yet not too often</li>
        <li> write proper commit messages</li>
    </uo>

<p> </p>

<p>Edit: 09/10/24</p>
<p>The second lesson in the CSS block requires to add what I have learnt in CSS in this project.</p>
<p>I will add two css files:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a 'style.css' to style the index.html</li>
        <li>a 'pagestyle.css' to style the 3 pages with the recipes.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Edit: 16/10/24</p>
<p>The last lesson in the CSS block requires to add my knowledge about the box model.</p>
